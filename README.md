# Extracting musical features using Restricted Boltzmann Machines
This is a project I did in 2011 during my master studies at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (DIKU)](http://diku.dk/). The code and the report is published here on Github for reading purposes only.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the [Shark Machine Learning Library](https://github.com/Shark-ML/Shark) for training RBMs and on [Marsyas](https://github.com/marsyas/marsyas) for the music information retrieval.

Besides the libraries, you also need a dataset of music audio files divided into 10 genres, which is not supplied with this source code.

## Report
See the report for a detailed description of the method and the results.
